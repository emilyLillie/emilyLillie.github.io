I just finished up my first portfolio project, a CLI Data Gem. The gem itself is pretty simple; it scrapes a website containing some information on Greek gods and goddesses and returns that information to the user. I got the idea because I feel like everyone's first big project in sixth grade is to do a report on Greek or Roman gods for history class. I thought it would be fun to something similar, but using what I'd learned about ruby programming. If you have a second, you can check it out at https://github.com/emilyLillie/olympians.
